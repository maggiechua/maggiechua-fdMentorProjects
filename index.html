        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine
        Look what you put me through
        Now that I'm the blue gangsta

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine
        The blue gangsta

        What you gonna do? 'Cause I'm gonna get you
        Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
        All the things you said and the things you've done to me
        You can no longer make me cry

        Look what you done to me, baby
        I can no longer smile, baby
        And I've waited so long, just to carry on
        I'm the blue gangsta

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine (gangster)
        Look what you put me through
        Now that I'm the blue gangsta (I'm the blue gangsta)

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine
        (I can never fall in love)
        The blue gangsta

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine (what you gonna do?)
        Look what you put me through
        Now that I'm the blue gangsta

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine
        (I can never fall in love)
        The blue gangsta

        You've tricked me nine to five, loving you is a crime
        People telling me, you got another guy
        I've been abused, watch me light the fuse
        Said you'd be my wife, nothing but big lies

        Don't know what I'd done, everything you got
        Things you done to me, coming back to you
        You know just what I've done, the things you done to me
        I'm the blue gangsta

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
        Look what you put me through
        Now that I'm the blue gangsta (I'm the blue gangsta)

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine
        (I can never fall in love)
        The blue gangsta

        What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
        You ain't no friend of mine (what you gonna do?)
        Look what you put me through
        Now that I'm the blue gangsta
        (Look what you put me through, girl)

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
        (I can never fall in love)
        The blue gangsta

        See, I am so amused to the things you said
        And the things you done, done to me
        There is nothing in this world that would make me change
        You make me wanna sing

        Nah, yeah
        The blue gangsta

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine (what you gonna do?)
        Look what you put me through
        Now that I'm the blue gangsta (look what you put me through, baby)

        What you gonna do?
        You ain't no friend of mine
        (I'm never gonna fall in love)
        The blue gangsta

        What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
        You ain't no friend of mine (what you gonna do?)
        Look what you put me through
        Now that I'm the blue gangsta (look what you put me through, girl)
        
        What you gonna do? (Oh no)
        You ain't no friend of mine
